- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @sparkerpro
- I'm a graduate student at Willamette University in Salem, OR, obtaining my Masters in Business Administration. I am tackling side-projects by learning R and intend to post the projects I am most proud of on this page. 
- Credit for any success I may have should be attributed to my great teachers of life, business, and data science.
